Bigquery

1. How would you optimize query performance in BigQuery?

Answer: To optimize BigQuery performance:
Partitioning: Divide tables by date, integer range, or ingestion time to reduce scanned data (e.g., PARTITION BY DATE(sale_date)).
Clustering: Sort data by columns to minimize data read during queries (e.g., CLUSTER BY customer_id).
**Avoid SELECT *** : Specify only required columns to reduce data scanned.
Use Materialized Views: Precompute aggregations for faster query execution.
Denormalize Data: Reduce joins by combining related data into a single table.
Caching: Leverage BigQueryâ€™s query caching for repeated queries.
